== Introduction to CredHubOperations

The interface `org.springframework.credhub.core.CredHubOperations` and the implementation `org.springframework.credhub.core.CredHubTemplate` are the central class in Spring CredHub.
A Spring bean of this type is created using Spring Boot auto-configuration when application properties are properly configured.
Application classes can autowire an instance of this bean to interact with a CredHub server.
