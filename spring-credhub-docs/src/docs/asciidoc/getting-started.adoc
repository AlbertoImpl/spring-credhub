== Getting started

Spring CredHub supports CredHub server version 1.x and 2.x.
This library is intended to provide full coverage of the CredHub API - all operations on all credential types.

Spring CredHub has been optimized to work with Spring Boot applications.
To include Spring CredHub in a Spring Boot application, add a dependency to the project build file.

=== Maven dependencies

Add the Spring CredHub starter to the `dependencies` section of the build file:

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.credhub</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-credhub-starter</artifactId>
            <version>${version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

=== Gradle dependencies

Add the Spring CredHub starter to the `dependencies` section of the build file:

    dependencies {
        compile('org.springframework.credhub:spring-credhub-starter:${version}')
    }
